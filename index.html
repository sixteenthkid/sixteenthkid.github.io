	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?<h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.urbandecay.com" taret="blank">UrbanDecay.com</a> and <a href="http://www.youthedesigner.com" taret="blank">Youthedesigner.com</a> </p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p> Urbandecay.com relies a lot on color and space.  The site is dark and uses the brand’s purple color, a bright yellow color and white contrasting text to draw the user’s eye.  At the top of the page there is a large rotating banner with each slide featuring a different product. The homepage relies more on images than text except for the extensive drop down menu.  The use of white space and contrasting dark and light sections on the site helps the site from feeling too dark and too heavy.</p>

	<p>Youthedesigner.com is a design blog. The header has a big logo and a horizontal navigation.  The links are little hard to read because of the shadow behind the words.  It has a large banner at the top, which shows featured articles on the site and changes every few seconds. Below the articles are displayed in a three-column layout with a large image and a short description for each.  The footer at the bottom has big links that are spaced out and easy to read.</p> 
 
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p> These two sites have completely different layouts but they both use space and color to make their content stand out.  They also both use images and graphics to grab attention of the user instead of a lot of text.</p>

	<p> Urban Decay uses a  contrasting one column and three column layout and has clear links to get the user to the product pages whereas YouTheDesigner uses a clean 3-column layout to display the articles on the site. </p>
